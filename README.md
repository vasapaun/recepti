# Chicken and Cream Cheese Pasta with Onions

Ingredients:

*    2 cups cooked macaroni
*    1 lb (about 450g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
*    1 cup cream cheese
*    1 cup milk or chicken broth
*    1 onion, thinly sliced
*    2 cloves garlic, minced
*    2 tablespoons olive oil or butter
*    Salt and pepper to taste
*    Chicken seasoning (about 1 teaspoon or to taste)
*    Paprika (about 1/2 teaspoon or to taste)
*    Optional: grated Parmesan cheese for serving, chopped parsley for garnish

Instructions:

    Heat olive oil or butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
    Add the sliced onions and minced garlic to the skillet. Cook until the onions are soft and translucent, stirring occasionally, for about 5-7 minutes.
    Season the chicken pieces with salt, pepper, chicken seasoning, and paprika.
    Add the seasoned chicken to the skillet with the onions and garlic. Cook until the chicken is fully cooked through and no longer pink in the center, stirring occasionally, for about 8-10 minutes.
    Reduce the heat to low. Stir in the cream cheese until melted and well combined with the chicken and onions.
    Pour in the milk or chicken broth, stirring constantly until the sauce is smooth and creamy. If the sauce is too thick, you can add more milk or broth until you reach your desired consistency.
    Add the cooked macaroni to the skillet, stirring to coat it evenly with the creamy sauce. Cook for a few more minutes until everything is heated through.
    Season with additional salt and pepper to taste, if needed.
    Serve hot, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley if desired.
